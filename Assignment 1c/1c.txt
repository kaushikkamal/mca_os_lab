Write a C program like the assignment 1(b) and over a user defined program into the address space of the child process using execv() system call. Again use wait() system call to synchronize the execution of parent program in your program until child process finishes. Here use the macro WIFEXITED to capture the returned status of the child in parent process. Also demonstrate the use of argument vector to print the program name by the child process.
