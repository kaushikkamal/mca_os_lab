/* You need to put proper explanatory comment in your program to demonstrate the purpose
and why you have used the C statements and system calls */

Write a C program which will take the Process ID and signal ID as input to demonstrate
the use of kill( ) system call.

Hints:
 
* For demonstrating so, you modify the assignment 3(a) to handle different signals as many possible where handler of each signal prints signal number. Run the modified assignment 3(a).

* Again from another terminal, run the assignment 3(b) which will take the Process ID of the modified assignment 3(a) and any valid signal value as input.

* Your signal handler function of the assignment 3(b) should be able to display the
signal ID of the generated signal.
