Write a C program that takes as input a list of processes, their arrival times and their CPU burst times. Schedule the processes into the CPU using Longest Time First (LJF) and Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) algorithms. For any tie breaking condition apply FCFS algorithm. Print the Gantt chart. Also compute their average waiting time and average turn around time.
