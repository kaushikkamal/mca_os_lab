Write a C program to create a child process using the system call fork( ) and from the child process, display the PID and PPID and also display the same from parent process. Demonstrate the use of exit(0) and exit(1).

Hints:

* There is a system call available in the LINUX to create a child process called fork(). Again the fork() system call returns the PID of the child process to the parent process and returns the value 0 to the child process. Moreover the return value type of the fork() system call is pid_t.

* For fork() system call , you need a header file #include<sys/types.h>

* To get the PID and PPID , we have two more system call getpid() and getppid() and the return types of both are int.
